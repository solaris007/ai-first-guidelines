Dashboards light up. Stakeholders applaud. The word \"velocity\" appears in every leadership sync.</p> <p>What follows is predictable. If two days is possible, why not one? If one engineer with AI can do this, why do we need five? The entire planning apparatus pivots toward maximizing throughput. Roadmaps swell. Backlogs that were carefully prioritized become \"just vibe it\" queues. The metric becomes features shipped, not features that work reliably at scale.</p> <p>Consider what \"just vibe it\" actually means. In any other engineering discipline, the equivalent phrase would end a career. \"Just vibe the load calculations.\" \"Just vibe the drug interactions.\" \"Just vibe the flight controller.\" We gave abdication of engineering judgment a charming verb, and now it shows up in sprint planning as if it were a methodology.</p> <p>This is the velocity trap: optimizing for output while ignoring the cost of that output.

The problem: the corporate AWS role structure classifies CloudWatch logs as security-critical. Log access is only available through power user or admin roles - roles that also grant write access to infrastructure. There is no \"read logs only\" role. Granting Cursor access to logs means granting Cursor the ability to modify, create, or delete production resources.

Every MCP server connection, every API token pasted into a config file, every \"just give it read access\" decision compounds. Traditional security practices accounted for humans accessing systems through known interfaces. AI-first development introduces autonomous agents accessing systems through APIs at machine speed, with broad context windows that can inadvertently expose sensitive data.</p> <p>There is also a compliance dimension.

SOC2 auditors, GDPR reviewers, and regulatory bodies are beginning to ask these questions, and most organizations do not have answers.</p> <p>The counterintuitive truth: AI-first development demands more security rigor, not less. More access controls, more audit logging, more principle-of-least-privilege enforcement, more credential rotation. The attack surface grew. The compliance surface grew.

Leadership is making real mistakes - optimizing for speed over safety, dissolving accountability, eroding the expertise pipeline. If you are an engineer who has been nodding along for the past several thousand words, good. You should be nodding. Those patterns are real, and you are right to name them.</p> <p>Now here is the part you will not like.</p> <p>This section is written in first person because it has to be. I have been the engineer who looked at AI-generated code and said \"this is not production-quality\" when what I actually meant was \"this took me a week and it just did it in twenty minutes and I need that to not be okay.\" I have watched myself manufacture objections that I later had to admit were aesthetic, not structural. I have felt the knot described above - and I have dressed it up as engineering judgment when it was not.</p> <p>If none of that resonates, either you have already done this work on yourself, or you are doing the thing right now where you tell yourself you are the exception.</p> <p>Here is what the resistance looks like from the inside:</p> <p>The quality objection that is not about quality. You review AI-generated code and find something to criticize. Sometimes the criticism is legitimate - AI does produce code with real deficiencies. But sometimes you find yourself reaching for objections you would not raise if a respected peer had written it. The standard shifts when the author is a machine, and you do not notice you shifted it. The test is simple and uncomfortable: would you raise this objection in a PR from a senior colleague you respect? If not, the objection is not about the code. It is about its origin.</p> <p>The complexity moat. You have built expertise over years and discovered - maybe not consciously - that being the person who knows hard things is a form of job security. When someone suggests using AI to document the system, to refactor for clarity, to make the architecture accessible to others, you raise legitimate-sounding concerns about \"losing nuance.\" What you are protecting is the organizational dependency on you personally. An engineer who makes a system knowable is more valuable than one who makes a system dependent on them. The first is expertise. The second is a hostage situation.</p> <p>The participation problem. Your organization wants you to write CLAUDE.md files that encode your knowledge, build guardrails that automate your judgment, mentor domain experts who will eventually ship without you. You are being asked to accelerate the compression of your own expertise into systems. This concern is partially legitimate - the Abolition Spiral section exists because this pattern is real. But here is the part we need to hear: senior engineers have always done this. You write libraries so the next person does not need to understand the internals. You write documentation so the next person does not need to call you. You mentor juniors who eventually stop needing you. AI did not create this dynamic. It accelerated it.</p> <p>The blast radius of refusal. When a respected senior engineer visibly refuses AI tools, every junior on the team receives a signal that skepticism is the sophisticated position. The juniors do not stop using AI - they stop asking for help. They learn to hide their AI usage rather than improve it. One senior holdout can stall adoption for an entire team, not through authority, but through social proof. Meanwhile, domain experts submitting PRs encounter review feedback calibrated to the author's title rather than the code's risk - a wall of concerns with no path through. That is not a quality gate. It is gatekeeping disguised as quality control, and it kills the domain expert pipeline this document describes.</p> <p>What the shift actually requires. The identity of \"I am the person who can do X\" needs to become \"I am the person who ensures X gets done well.\" The first identity is threatened by AI. The second is amplified by it. An engineer whose value is \"I can debug any production issue in this system\" is in a race with AI. An engineer whose value is \"I ensure this system is debuggable, by humans and AI alike, and I know when neither can be trusted\" is in a different category entirely. This is the mirror image of the Abolition Spiral. Leadership looks at AI and concludes they do not need senior engineers. Some senior engineers look at AI and conclude they do not need to change. Both are wrong for the same reason: they are protecting a comfortable position instead of making an honest assessment.</p> <p>The engineering side of the bargain: if leadership holds up its end - funds the 5%, respects the substrate boundary, does not eliminate the people building the parachutes - then we hold up ours. We stop using quality as a disguise for discomfort. We encode our knowledge generously. We review the diff, not the process that produced it. We shift our identity from \"the person who does the hard thing\" to \"the person who makes sure the hard thing gets done right.\"</p> <p>You spent a decade building expertise that AI cannot replicate.
