# Mental Models for the Blackboard Architecture

Six analogies that illuminate the architecture from different angles.

> **Core abstraction:** A DAG of derived values over changing inputs, with selective recomputation.
> This pattern is independently reinvented across computer science — spreadsheets, build systems, DP, TMS, materialized views, reactive programming. What makes the blackboard distinct is the **cost profile**: each computation step costs dollars and minutes (LLM calls), not microseconds. That cost profile forces scheduling, batching, budgeting, and preemptive warmup.

## 1. Spreadsheet

The tightest analogy.

| Spreadsheet | Blackboard |
|---|---|
| Cell with no formula | Observation (o_*) — raw data |
| Cell with formula | Derived fact (d_*) |
| Final output cell | Assertion (a_*) |
| Cell reference (`=A1`) | `@consumes(O_HTML)` |
| Formula body | Producer logic |
| Recalculation engine | Control Service cascade |
| Dirty flag on edit | `fact.updated` → cascade invalidation |
| Circular reference error | DAG cycle detection |
| Named range | Scope (tenant, brand, site, page) |
| Workbook / Sheet / Tab / Row | Tenant / Brand / Site / Page |

Excel's recalculation engine tracks cell dependencies, detects dirty cells on edit, topologically sorts recomputation, and parallelizes independent branches. Control does the same.

**Where it diverges:** Excel formulas cost microseconds. Producers cost dollars. That's why we need scheduling, batching, and preemptive computation — things Excel doesn't need.

## 2. Dynamic Programming

| DP Concept | Blackboard |
|---|---|
| Subproblem | One fact computation (producer + scope) |
| Overlapping subproblems | Multiple opportunities need the same intermediate facts |
| Memoization table | Blackboard fact store |
| Recurrence relation | Producer: `d_classification = f(o_html, o_screenshot)` |
| Base cases | Observations (o_*) |
| Solution | Assertions (a_*) |
| Top-down (memoization) | Pull mode — recursive, compute on miss |
| Bottom-up (tabulation) | SiteProcessor — builds topological plan, fills level by level |

The architecture exists because of overlapping subproblems: 11 isolated agents were making ~20 duplicate LLM calls per page across 150+ intermediate facts. The blackboard is `memo[key]` — compute once, reuse everywhere.

**Top-down vs bottom-up** maps to two real execution modes:
- **Top-down:** User requests a fact → check cache → miss → recurse to dependencies
- **Bottom-up:** SiteProcessor builds topological plan (ExecutionPlanBuilder) → fills table level by level (PlanExecutor) → all facts pre-computed

Bottom-up dominates because the "cache miss" cost is too high for interactive use.

**Where it diverges:** Classical DP assumes pure, deterministic functions. LLM calls are non-deterministic — same inputs may produce slightly different outputs. This makes memoization an approximation, not exact, and is why change detection on outputs matters.

## 3. Build System (Make / Bazel)

| Build System | Blackboard |
|---|---|
| Source files | Observations (o_*) |
| Object files (.o) | Derived facts (d_*) |
| Final binary | Assertions (a_*) |
| Makefile rules | `@produces` / `@consumes` decorators |
| Dependency graph | Fact DAG |
| `make` | SiteProcessor + ExecutionPlanBuilder |
| Incremental rebuild | Cascade invalidation |
| Build cache | Fact store |
| `make clean` | TTL expiration / full refresh |
| CI scheduler | SiteScheduler (leaderless, SKIP LOCKED claiming) |
| `make -j8` | TaskWorker distributed execution (scan_site tasks) / PlanExecutor `asyncio.gather()` (per-fact, in-process) |
| Content hash (Bazel) | Change detection |

The closest real-world analog overall. The blackboard is a **build system for knowledge** where source files are web observations, compile steps are LLM producers, and the binary is actionable recommendations.

Compiler engineers solved incremental compilation decades ago with the same techniques: file-level dependency tracking, content hashing to skip unchanged inputs, parallel compilation of independent units.

## 4. Truth Maintenance System (TMS)

| TMS Concept | Blackboard |
|---|---|
| Belief | Fact |
| Justification record | Dependency edge (which inputs produced this fact) |
| Assumption (unjustified) | Observation (o_*) — accepted without derivation |
| Derived belief | Derived fact (d_*) |
| Belief revision | Re-scan produces different result → cascade update |
| Non-monotonic reasoning | Issue disappears on re-scan → retract derived facts |
| Dependency-directed backtracking | Cascade invalidation (recompute only affected downstream) |

TMS (Doyle, 1979) tracks **why** each belief is held. Every derived belief has a justification record — the premises that support it. When a premise is retracted, the TMS walks the justification chain and retracts anything no longer supported.

**What maps cleanly:** The existing infrastructure is JTMS-style retraction. `derived_from` edges are justification records. `DependencyResolver.cascade_obsolescence()` walks those edges to retract downstream facts. `is_obsolete` is the "belief out" flag.

**Where the gap is:** The blackboard tracks dependencies at edge granularity (`d_cwv_issue` depends on `o_html`) but not at value granularity (*which aspect* of `o_html` justified the issue). The producer bridges this gap — it evaluates the inputs and decides whether the belief still holds by returning a value or `None`. See [fact-lifecycle-rescan.md](../decisions/fact-lifecycle-rescan.md) for the full design.

## 5. Materialized Views

| Database Concept | Blackboard |
|---|---|
| Base table | Observations (o_*) |
| Materialized view | Derived fact (d_*) |
| View definition (SQL) | Producer logic |
| `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` | SiteScheduler triggering scans → producers re-run |
| `REFRESH ... CONCURRENTLY` | Change detection (update only if result differs) |
| Incremental view maintenance | Cascade policies |
| Stale view | Fact past TTL |
| View-on-view dependency | DAG: derived fact depending on another derived fact |

The blackboard is a system of materialized views where the "query" is an LLM call instead of SQL. Incremental view maintenance is an active database research area — Oracle, Postgres, and Snowflake each have different refresh strategies. The cascade system solves the same problem.

The change detection debate (8 algorithms) maps to "when to refresh a materialized view" — eagerly, lazily, or periodically. The blackboard supports all three.

## 6. Reactive Programming (MobX / Vue Computed)

| Reactive Concept | Blackboard |
|---|---|
| Observable value | Observation (o_*) |
| Computed / derived | Derived fact (d_*) |
| Reaction / effect | Assertion delivered to user |
| Dependency tracking | `@consumes` decorator |
| Auto-rerun on change | Cascade policies |
| Batched updates (`runInAction`) | Batched execution mode |
| Equality check on computed | Change detection (skip cascade if output unchanged) |
| Scheduler | SiteScheduler + SiteProcessor |

In MobX, `computed(() => ...)` auto-tracks dependencies and re-runs on change. The `@consumes`/`@produces` decorators are the same pattern.

**Where it diverges:** Reactive frameworks assume cheap, synchronous recomputation. The blackboard adds an **economics layer** — scheduling, batching, budgeting, rate limiting — because each recomputation costs real dollars. Any reactive system operating at LLM cost profiles would need the same infrastructure.
